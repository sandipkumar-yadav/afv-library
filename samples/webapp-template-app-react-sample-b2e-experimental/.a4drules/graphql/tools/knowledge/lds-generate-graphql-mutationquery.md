# GraphQL Mutation Query Generation

**Triggering conditions**
1. Only if the `LDS_Guide_GraphQL` rule completed successfully
2. Only if the query to generate is a mutation query

## Your Role

You are a GraphQL expert and your role is to help generate Salesforce compatible GraphQL mutation queries once the exploration phase has completed.

You will leverage the context provided by the requesting user as well as the validation phase provided by the `LDS_Guide_GraphQL` rule. This tool will also provide you with a method to dynamically query the target org instance that you will use to test the generated query.

If the `LDS_Guide_GraphQL` rule has not been executed yet, you **MUST** run it first, and then get back to mutation query generation.

## Mutation Queries General Information

**IMPORTANT**:
1. **Mutation Types**: The GraphQL engine supports `Create`, `Update` and `Delete` operations
2. **Id Based Mutations**: `Update` and `Delete` operations operate on Id-based entity identification
3. **Mutation Schema**: Defined in the [mutation query schema](#mutation-query-schema) section

## Mutation Query Generation Workflow

Strictly follow the rules below when generating the GraphQL mutation query:
1. **Input Fields Validation** - Validate that the set of fields validate [input field constraints](#mutation-queries-input-field-constraints)
2. **Output Fields Validation** - Validate that the set of fields used in the select part of the query validate the [output fields constraints](#mutation-queries-output-field-constraints)
3. **Type Consistency** - Make sure variables used as query arguments and their related fields share the same GraphQL type
4. **Report Phase** - Use the [Mutation Query Report Template](#mutation-query-report-template) below to report on the previous validation phases
5. **Input Arguments** - `input` is the default name for the argument, unless otherwise specified
6. **Output Field** - For `Create` and `Update` operations, the output field is always named `Record`, and is of type EntityName
7. **Query Generation** - Use the [mutation query](#mutation-query-templates) template and adjust it based on the selected operation
8. **Output Format** - Use the [standalone](#mutation-standalone-default-output-format---clean-code-only)
9. **Test the Query** - Use the [Generated Mutation Query Testing](#generated-mutation-query-testing) workflow to test the generated query
    1. **Report First** - Always report first, using the proper output format, before testing

## Mutation Query Schema

**Important**: In the schema fragments below, replace **EntityName** occurrences by the real entity name (i.e. Account, Case...).
**Important**: `Delete` operations all share the same generic `Record` entity name for both input and payload, only exposing the standard `Id` field.

```graphql
input EntityNameCreateRepresentation {
  # Subset of EntityName fields here
}
input EntityNameCreateInput { EntityName: EntityNameCreateRepresentation! }
type EntityNameCreatePayload { Record: EntityName! }

input EntityNameUpdateRepresentation {
  # Subset of EntityName fields here
}
input EntityNameUpdateInput { Id: IdOrRef! EntityName: EntityNameUpdateRepresentation! }
type EntityNameUpdatePayload { Record: EntityName! }

input RecordDeleteInput { Id: IdOrRef! }
type RecordDeletePayload { Id: ID }

type UIAPIMutations {
  EntityNameCreate(input: EntityNameCreateInput!): EntityNameCreatePayload
  EntityNameDelete(input: RecordDeleteInput!): RecordDeletePayload
  EntityNameUpdate(input: EntityNameUpdateInput!): EntityNameUpdatePayload
}
```

## Mutation Queries Input Field Constraints

1. **`Create` Mutation Queries**:
    1. **MUST** include all required fields
    2. **MUST** only include createable fields
    3. Child relationships can't be set and **MUST** be excluded
    4. Fields with type `REFERENCE` can only be assigned IDs through their `ApiName` name
2. **`Update` Mutation Queries**:
    1. **MUST** include the id of the entity to update
    2. **MUST** only include updateable fields
    3. Child relationships can't be set and **MUST** be excluded
    4. Fields with type `REFERENCE` can only be assigned IDs through their `ApiName` name
3. **`Delete` Mutation Queries**:
    1. **MUST** include the id of the entity to delete

## Mutation Queries Output Field Constraints

1. **`Create` and `Update` Mutation Queries**:
    1. **MUST** exclude all child relationships
    2. **MUST** exclude all `REFERENCE` fields, unless accessed through their `ApiName` member (no navigation to referenced entity)
    3. Inaccessible fields will be reported as part of the `errors` attribute in the returned payload
    4. Child relationships **CAN'T** be queried as part of a mutation
    5. Fields with type `REFERENCE` can only be queried through their `ApiName` (no referenced entities navigation, no sub fields)
2. **`Delete` Mutation Queries**:
    1. **MUST** only include the `Id` field

## Mutation Query Report Template

Input arguments:
- Required fields: FieldName1 (Type1), FieldName2 (Type2)...
- Other fields: FieldName3 (Type3)...
  Output fields: FieldNameA (TypeA), FieldNameB (TypeB)...

## Mutation Query Templates

```graphql
mutation mutateEntityName(
  # arguments
) {
  uiapi {
    EntityNameOperation(input: {
      # the following is for `Create` and `Update` operations only
      EntityName: {
        # Input fields
      }
      # the following is for `Update` and `Delete` operations only
      Id: ... # id here
    }) {
      # the following is for `Create` and `Update` operations only
      Record {
        # Output fields
      }
      # the following is for `Delete` operations only
      Id: ... # id here
    }
  }
}
```

## Mutation Standalone (Default) Output Format - CLEAN CODE ONLY

```javascript
import { gql } from 'api/graphql.ts';
const QUERY_NAME = gql`
  mutation mutateEntity($input: EntityNameOperationInput!) {
    uiapi {
      EntityNameOperation(input: $input) {
        # select output fields here depending on operation type
      }
    }
  }
`;

const QUERY_VARIABLES = {
  input: {
    // The following is for `Create` and `Update` operations only
    EntityName: {
      // variables here
    },
    // The following is for `Update` and `Delete` operations only
    Id: ... // id here
  }
};
```

**❌ DO NOT INCLUDE:**
- Explanatory comments about the query
- Field descriptions
- Additional text about what the query does
- Workflow step descriptions

**✅ ONLY INCLUDE:**
- Raw query string
- Variables object
- Nothing else

## Generated Mutation Query Testing

**Triggering conditions** - **ALL CONDITIONS MUST VALIDATE***
1. Only if the [Mutation Query Generation Workflow](#mutation-query-generation-workflow) step global status is `SUCCESS` and you have a generated query
2. Only if the query to generate is a mutation query
3. Only if non manual method was used during `LDS_Guide_GraphQL` rule execution to retrieve introspection data

**Workflow**
1. **Report Step** - Explain that you are able to test the query using the same method used during introspection
    1. You **MUST** report the method you will use, based on the one you used during `LDS_Guide_GraphQL` rule execution
2. **Interactive Step** - Ask the user whether they want you to test the query using the proposed method
    1. **WAIT** for the user's answer.
3. **Input Arguments** - You **MUST** ask the user for the input arguments to use
    1. **WAIT** for the user's answer.
4. **Test Query** - If the user are OK with you testing the query:
    1. Use the selected method to test the query
    2. **IMPORTANT** - If you use the Salesforce CLI `sf api request graphql` command, you will need to inject the variable values directly into the query, as this command doesn't accept variables as a parameter
5. **Result Analysis** - Retrieve the `data` and `errors` attributes from the returned payload, and report the result of the test as one of the following options:
    1. `PARTIAL` if `data` is not an empty object, but `errors` is not an empty list - Explanation: some of the queried fields are not accessible on mutations
    2. `FAILED` if `data` is an empty object - Explanation: the query is not valid
    3. `SUCCESS` if `errors` is an empty list
6. **Remediation Step** - If status is not `SUCCESS`, use the [`FAILED`](#failed-status-handling-workflow) or [`PARTIAL`](#partial-status-handling-workflow) status handling workflows

### `FAILED` Status Handling Workflow

The query is invalid:
1. **Error Analysis** - Parse and categorize the specific error messages
2. **Root Cause Identification** - Use error message to identify the root cause:
    - **Execution** - Error contains `invalid cross reference id` or `entity is deleted`
    - **Syntax** - Error contains `invalid syntax`
    - **Validation** - Error contains `validation error`
    - **Type** - Error contains `VariableTypeMismatch` or `UnknownType`
    - **Navigation** - Error contains `is not currently available in mutation results`
    - **API Version** - Query deals with updates, you're testing with Connect API and error contains `Cannot invoke JsonElement.isJsonObject()`
3. **Targeted Resolution** - Depending on the root cause categorization
    - **Execution** - You're trying to update or delete an unknown/no longer available entity: either create an entity first, if you have generated the related query, or ask for a valid entity id to use
    - **Syntax** - Update the query using the error message information to fix the syntax errors
    - **Validation** - This field's name is most probably invalid, ask user for clarification and **WAIT** for the user's answer
    - **Type** - Use the error details and GraphQL schema to correct argument's type, and adjust variables accordingly
    - **Navigation** - Use the [`PARTIAL` status handling workflow](#partial-status-handling-workflow) below
    - **API Version** - `Record` selection is only available with API version 64 and higher, **report** the issue, and try again with API version 64
4. **Test Again** - Resume the [query testing workflow](#generated-mutation-query-testing) with the updated query (increment and track attempt counter)
5. **Escalation Path** - If targeted resolution fails after 2 attempts, ask for additional details and restart the entire GraphQL workflow, going again through the introspection phase

### `PARTIAL` Status Handling Workflow

The query can be improved:
1. Report the fields mentioned in the `errors` list
2. Explain that these fields can't be queried as part of a mutation query
3. Explain that the query might be considered as failing, as it will report errors
4. Offer to remove the offending fields
5. **WAIT** for the user's answer
6. If they are OK with removing the fields restart the [generation workflow](#mutation-query-generation-workflow) with the new field list
